<h1>Metamorphosis.Franz Kafka</h1>
<p style="text-indent:20px">The protagonist of the story, Gregor Samza, a simple salesman, wakes up in the morning and discovers that he has turned into a huge vile insect. In the manner characteristic of Kafka, the cause of metamorphosis, the events preceding it, are not disclosed. The reader, like the characters in the story, is simply confronted with the fact that the transformation has taken place.</p>
<p style="text-indent:20px">The protagonist of the novel, Gregor Samza, is the breadwinner of his family, consisting of his father, a completely ruined Prague inhabitant, his mother, who suffers from asthma, and sister Greta. In order to save the family from begging, Gregor works for one of his father's creditors as a traveling salesman, cloth merchant. He is constantly on the move, but one day, during a break between such trips, he spent the night at home, and in the morning when he woke up, an incident happened that went beyond human understanding. Gregor turned into a beetle. Waking up one morning after a restless sleep, Gregor Samsa found that he had turned into a terrible insect in his bed. Lying on his armor-hard back, he saw, as soon as he raised his head, his brown, bulging belly, divided by arcuate scales, on the top of which the blanket, ready to finally slide off, could hardly hold. His many legs, pathetically thin compared to the rest of his body, swarm helplessly before his eyes.</p>

<p style="text-indent:20px">“What happened to me?” he thought. It wasn't a dream."</p>
<p style="text-indent:20px">The novel begins with these words.</p>

<p style="text-indent:20px">But that was only the beginning of all the trouble. Further, worse. As a result of this unusual transformation of Gregor into a bug, he was fired from his job, naturally, he could no longer work, provide his family with money and pay off his father's debt.</p>

<p style="text-indent:20px">Each member of the family reacted to Gregor's transformation in their own way. This angered the father, he could not understand how his son could be in the body of a beetle. The mother was very frightened and upset, but still did not lose maternal feelings, and understood that her son was in this body. Sister Greta, considered the beetle disgusting, but, despite this, she took on the burden of caring for him. It is impossible to say whether out of kindred feelings, or out of a desire to show her parents her independence, or maybe out of gratitude, Greta looked after the beetle, but most likely, the second option is closest to the truth.</p>

<p style="text-indent:20px">Gregor's exit into the living room, when all the family members and the boss from his work were there, should by no means be regarded as a challenge to society. From the words and thoughts of Gregor, one can understand that he is a person with a heightened sense of responsibility. The hero left the room to people in his current state, only because, due to a sense of duty and understanding of the importance of his duties to his family and employer, he completely forgot about his poor health and unusual transformation.</p>

<p style="text-indent:20px">Gregor's decision to die was influenced by many factors of his existence as a beetle...</p>

<p style="text-indent:20px">Firstly, he was very lonely, his consciousness could not stand life in a beetle body. Secondly, he could no longer help his family make ends meet financially. Thirdly, and most importantly, Gregor Samsa loved his family very much and spent his whole life sacrificing himself for her, and now he could no longer do this, instead he became a burden for his parents. On the last day of his life, he heard his sister say that if he had been reasonable and loved his family, he would have left them and would not interfere, Greta pressed on his conscience, and Gregor could not stand it.</p>

<p style="text-indent:20px"> Gregor turned into a beetle most likely because even when he was in a human body, his life was more like that of a beetle than a man. He selflessly worked not for himself, but for the sake of his family, he was not interested in anything and was lonely. Or perhaps it was necessary for him to see the ingratitude of his family, who cared only for financial problems.</p>
