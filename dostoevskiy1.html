<h1>White nights.F.M.Dostoevsky</h1>
<p style="text-indent:20px">The story "White Nights" is dedicated to A.N. Pleshcheev, a friend of Dostoevsky's youth, and some critics argue that Pleshcheev became the prototype of the protagonist. Some, however, object that the image of the protagonist is the image of the youngest Dostoevsky, and it is no coincidence that the author narrates in the first person, hinting at autobiography.</p>

    <p style="text-indent:20px"></p>Compositionally, the story consists of 5 chapters, 4 chapters are devoted to nights in St. Petersburg, the last one is called "Morning". The construction is symbolic: romantic nights are the stages of the protagonist's consistent love for the main character, the stages of his development, and at the end he, morally perfect, stands on the threshold of his morning - insight. He found love, but unrequited, therefore, on the morning of his insight, he yields his love to another, gets rid of dreams and, experiencing a real feeling, makes a real deed.</p>

    <p style="text-indent:20px"></p>Morning simultaneously dispels empty hopes and breaks off a series of wonderful meetings, it becomes the beginning and end of the hero's drama.</p>

    <p style="text-indent:20px"></p>The plot of the story: the young man, on behalf of whom the story is being told, came to St. Petersburg 8 years ago. He works, and in his spare time he looks at cityscapes and dreams. One day, he rescues a girl on the embankment who is being chased by a drunk. The girl tells the Dreamer that she is waiting on the embankment of her lover, who was going to come for her exactly a year ago, having made an appointment for these days. For several days the girl waits for him, but he does not come, and she begins to despair.</p>

    <p style="text-indent:20px"></p>The dreamer communicates with Nastenka, takes upon himself the transfer of the letter to her lover, and falls in love with the girl himself. Nastenka also falls in love, and they are even going to get married, when suddenly the former lover appears again and takes Nastenka away. A cold, dank Petersburg morning is coming, the Dreamer feels sobering and devastated.</p>

    <p style="text-indent:20px"></p>The main character of the story is the Dreamer.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:20px"></p>The dreamer is a 26-year-old resident of St. Petersburg. He is educated, but poor, has certain prospects, but has no worldly desires. He serves somewhere, but does not converge with colleagues and other people around him - for example, women. He is not interested in either the domestic side of life, or money, or girls, he is constantly immersed in illusory romantic dreams and during periods of contact with the world around him experiences a painful feeling of alienation from this world. He compares himself with a dirty kitten, not needed by anyone in the world and experiencing reciprocal resentment and enmity. However, he would not be unresponsive if they needed him - after all, people are not repulsive to him, he would be ready to help someone, capable of empathy.</p>

    <p style="text-indent:20px"></p>The dreamer is a typical "little man" (social position, inability to act, immobility, invisibility of existence) and "an extra person" (he feels himself to be such, despising only himself for his uselessness).</p>

    <p style="text-indent:20px"></p>The main character, 17-year-old Nastenka, is opposed to the Dreamer as an active character. Despite the outward fragility and naivety and young age, she is stronger than the Dreamer in the search for happiness. The writer uses many words with diminutive suffixes - "eyes", "handles", "pretty", emphasizing the childishness and spontaneity of the image, its playfulness, restlessness, like a child's. The habits of a child, her heart is a real woman: she skillfully uses the help of an adult man, but at the same time, clearly recognizing his sensitive and indecisive nature, stubbornly does not notice his feelings. At a critical moment, however, when it becomes clear that her lover has abandoned her, she quickly orients herself and finally notices these very feelings. At the moment of the appearance of a potential husband, he again looks at the feelings of the Dreamer as a friendly participation.</p>
