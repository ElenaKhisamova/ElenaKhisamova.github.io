<p style="text-indent:20px">
    The Picture of Dorian Gray is a famous novel by the English writer Oscar Wilde, which caused considerable public outcry and even a scandal immediately after its publication in London, in 1891. Now this work is very popular with readers around the world. Here you can read a brief analysis of this work.
    The principles of aestheticism in the novel "The Picture of Dorian Gray":
    Oscar Wilde was a supporter of the principles of aestheticism - the literary and philosophical trend in English art of the late XIX - early XX centuries. The main provisions are set out in the preface to the novel in the form of aphorisms. Aestheticism affirms the superiority of art over life: the artist's imagination is more valuable than a simple copy of reality. Oscar Wilde speaks of the futility of art in the sense that it should not pursue any purpose, it serves for the pleasure of man, and an analysis of the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray clearly reveals this.</p>

    Problems of the novel "The Picture of Dorian Gray":</p>
    <p style="text-indent:20px">
    The Picture of Dorian Gray reveals several themes that are very important in Wilde's work. Even after reading the summary of the novel, you will notice this. The theme of the artist, creativity, the power of art are central in the novel. Basil Hallward is a talented portrait painter and admirer of beauty. But in his view, aesthetic and ethical, beauty and morality are inseparable. Therefore, he anxiously follows the life of the protagonist and reproaches him, trying to convince him to give up vices. Mark this thought if you are doing a brief analysis of The Picture of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry, on the contrary, expresses the idea that the main thing in life is pleasure. Beauty is free from moral laws, enjoyment is the only thing that matters in life. He, as a tempter, develops the selfishness and depravity of the protagonist, who believes that youth and beauty are the main values.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:20px">The image of the protagonist in the analysis of the novel "The Picture of Dorian Gray":</p>
    <p style="text-indent:20px">The work depicts the life of Dorian Gray, who put beauty and pleasure at the forefront. In the first chapter, he is shown as a beautiful young man, whose external beauty is in harmony with his spiritual purity. For the first time, he thinks about his beauty when he hears the admiring speeches of the artist. Then the thought of her fragility takes possession of him, and he is ready to give everything to save her. Looking at the portrait, Dorian Gray says: let the portrait grow old, he himself remains forever young. And so it happens. All life, experiences, passions, vices are reflected in the portrait. The portrait becomes a reflection of the hero's soul. The portrait is first changed when Dorian betrays his beloved, Sibyl Vane. The girl was an actress in a small poor theater, where Dorian accidentally went. She talentedly played the love of Shakespeare's heroines on stage. Young people began to meet and confessed their love to each other. The young man decided to show it to his friends. But on the day of the performance, she thought only of love for Dorian, so she played poorly. Dorian's friends, like himself, were disappointed. The young man rudely expresses his disappointment to his beloved and says that he no longer loves her. The next day, he realized the injustice of the reproaches, but it was too late: the girl was poisoned. Lord Henry leads the young man to think that there is nothing to worry about, and Dorian dismissively recalls his acquaintance with her. At this moment, looking at the portrait, the hero notices that a cruel fold has appeared near the lips.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:20px">Subsequently, Dorian indulges in vices, wanders through the slums, sinks lower and lower morally. Oscar Wilde does not tell in detail about the life of the hero, hinting only that he sank to the very bottom in pursuit of pleasure. The depravity and cruelty of Dorian are mentioned by many heroes of the work. He lives a double life: attending social events and the dirty quarters of the East End, striking everyone with his unchanging beauty, and shudderingly watching the terrible changes in the portrait..</p>
