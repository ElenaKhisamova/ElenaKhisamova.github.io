<h1>The Insulted And The Injured.F.M.Dostoevsky</h1>
<p style="text-indent:20px">
    The novel "Humiliated and Insulted" is a work by Fyodor Dostoevsky, written some time after returning from exile, where he was in exile. In 1857, Dostoevsky already had certain sketches of the future novel and was thinking about the idea, but he took up the pen only a few years later. The spring issue of Vremya magazine in 1861 printed the first part of the novel, and after that each issue of the edition contained a continuation of the story. "Poor people", left without protection and support, is the theme of the novel. These people are humiliated, offended and destitute. The novel can be attributed to a certain experiment of the writer, since only in the following works did he work out all the details to the smallest detail. We are talking about certain artistic techniques, storylines and images. To make the analysis of the novel "The Humiliated and Insulted" more complete, one should pay attention to the heroes of the work. For example, Pyotr Alexandrovich Valkovsky's image is not the most attractive - he is completely devoted to the service of evil, and in it the author has collected all the negativity of a wealthy society. Valkovsky is an egoist, he is callous and very mercenary. This person is not averse to meanness and cruelty, and for the sake of money he is ready to do anything. Even his marriage was calculated, because having received what he wanted, that is, material gain, he even threw Nellie's mother, who was pregnant, out of the house. Or if you look at the son of Valkovsky - his father does not need him until he sees the opportunity to successfully marry him. To do this, the prince is ready to destroy the well-being of the Ikhmenev family. Without a twinge of conscience, he slandered the person who brought up his child and helped restore the property that was on the verge of ruin.
    Despite the beauty of the prince, his nature is disgusting, and the further you go, the more clearly you can see what is hidden behind courtesy and outward gloss - deceit and greed. However, in the novel there is a completely opposite hero - this is the narrator Ivan Petrovich. Young Fyodor Dostoevsky reminds readers of this aspiring writer very much. He is noble, ready and willing to help complete strangers, although he himself is not rich, if not poor. These two characters are directly opposed to each other. Seeing how mercenary the prince was, we see Ivan Petrovich, who selflessly and kindly supports Nelly. He can even take such a step as nobility in love - to give the girl he loves to another so that she stays with another man, if only she herself is happy.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:20px">This novel, in fact, is a psychological essay, where the author carefully examines such a phenomenon as human egoism. Moreover, its most striking manifestation is the behavior of Valkovsky. We also mention his son Alexei. He is also selfish by nature, and the prospects of a rich life beckon him. When the question arises of who to give preference to - Katya or Natasha, Alexei chooses a richer bride, that is, Katya. The young man is afraid that as soon as he loses his father's financial support, his comfortable life will end, and even the fact that Natasha is ready to work does not interest him. The problem of selfishness is also visible when considering the image of Natasha, because focusing on her suffering, she does not care about what happens to her parents. She is blinded by feelings for Alexei, but they cannot be called true love, this is also a manifestation of selfishness. Obsessed with hatred and deep resentment, old Smith and Nikolai Ikhmenev can also be called egoists, because they are indifferent to loved ones, and their pride is above everything else. The image of Nelly also emphasizes Dostoevsky's idea of selfishness in society. True, her selfishness can be called "selfishness of suffering." She feeds on feelings of self-pity, and is already used to feeling like a victim. Nelly does not trust anyone, perceives others as cruel and heartless, and is against anyone taking care of her.</p>
